# Functionality
Restrictions for variable declaration are next:
    1) First goes a variable, for example: A 2 =, c 3 6 + 2 - =.
    2) You may declare a variable using 1 character, from a-z and A-Z.
You can perform following operations.
    Simple mathematical expressions - '+ -  * / %'.
And some extra things:
    1) Swap top 2 elements - '$'.
    2) Print top element without poping - '#'.
    3) Clear every data structure we have - '~'.
    4) Duplicate top element of the stack - ':'.
If you want to quit, print 'q' or 'Q'. (P.S. You  cannot declare variables with these names)
