# Reverse-polish-notation-calculator

Here is implementation of reverse polish calculator, I've created this for educational purpose. Advantage of this calcualator is that is doesn't need to handle brackets. 

# Functionality
Restrictions for variable declaration are next: 
- First goes a variable, for example: A 2 =, c 3 6 + 2 - =. 
- You may declare a variable using 1 character, from a-z and A-Z.

You can perform following operations.
- Simple mathematical expressions - '+ -  * / %'.
- Swap top 2 elements - '$'.
- Print top element without poping - '#'.
- Clear every data structure we have - '~'.
- Duplicate top element of the stack - ':'.

If you want to quit, print 'q' or 'Q'. (P.S. You  cannot declare variables with these names)

# Compilation
To compile this calculator I used MSVC. On Windows I prefer to use .bat files for building projects, so you can make that too. On Linux I use standard makefile.
